## Lab 1

1. Sam Reinart, SamReinart
2. In his most recent commit, he added the hw1.Rmd and hw1.html files into this repository. He committed these files with the comment being 'completed hw1 with knitted html.' The commit id is a3ec5da91ac1f94c38ce3d9f27a85f4d5bb09e0e
3. I was able to successfully knit Sam's hw1.Rmd file without any errors happening. 
4. In this lab I encountered no errors. The only thing that will help me is by practicing and performing these tasks more often. Right now, I'm a little slow and inefficient. With time and practice, I will become better at collaborting with others by using GitHub.
